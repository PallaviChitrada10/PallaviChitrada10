### Hi, you are at Pallavi's base camp ✨

My technology journey didn’t start with complex code; it began with the simple, elegant logic of truth tables. That fundamental curiosity about how information connects evolved into a passion for the two core pillars of data: high-performance storage and impactful insights.

I architect and optimize data systems that turn complex information into clear insights. If there’s a way to make a database faster or a pipeline more efficient, I'm already on it.

A great data work resembles a culinary masterpiece: from _administering_ the cloud kitchen and _architecting_ the data recipe to _transforming_ raw ingredients through ETL and _visualizing_ the final plating for business insights.

Even though I operate in 'two boats', Administration and Analytics, I specialize in providing the bridge between them. I ensure that the way we store data directly supports the way we represent it for critical business needs.
